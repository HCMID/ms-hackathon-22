Welcome to the home page for the Holy Cross MID Hackathon 2022.

Our text this year will be the *Aratus Latinus* from the manuscript St. Gallen Stiftsbibliothek 250.  You can find out more about our manuscript on the [e-codices website](https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/searchresult/list/one/csg/0250), and can browse [citable images here](./browser/).

### Summary of our schedule


- Friday afternoon, Feb. 11:  optionally drop in to MID's regular Friday  meeting via Zoom for a tech checkup.  We can help you install or configure any software you need help with.
- Saturday  morning, Feb. 12: introduction to our editing system with interactive notebooks to validate your editing
- Saturday afternoon, Feb. 12: you'll work with one or more current MID students to edit a selection from our manuscript.


### Technical preparation

You can participate in our hackathon in either of two roles:

1. *Contributing editors* can work entirely in a web browser.  In addition, you can have a little more flexibility in your participation if you download the text editor we use to collaborate remotely, [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
2. *Hosts*: in addition to a web browser, hosts should install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), and the [Julia](https://julialang.org/downloads/) language. That's it!
